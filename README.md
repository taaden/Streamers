# Climate Change (Group Project)
## Overview of the Project
  * The purpose of the analysis was to explore the Earth surface temperature data from 1900 to 2013 to see the trend of 
    of United States temperature,and to used the dataset to build a machine learning model to predict future temperatures in the 
    the Uited States
    
### Reasons for Selecting Topic
  * To see if the data surport the general consencus of global warming.
  * To see the temperature trend across the United States.
  * To add to the body of proof and evidence of global warming useing the United States Data

### Data Source Description
    We used the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley
    National Laboratory.The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 
    pre-existing archives.It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). 
    They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied.

#### Questions we wish to answer
   * What is the trend of  average land temperature in United States
   * Is there any evidence of increase land temperature from United States Dataset
   * What is acuracy and precision of the model
