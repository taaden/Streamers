# Climate Change (Group Project)
## Overview of the Project
  * The purpose of the analysis was to explore the Earth surface temperature data from 1900 to 2013 to see the trends of 
    of United States temperature,and to used the dataset to build a machine learning model to predict future temperatures in the 
    the United States.
    
### Reasons for Selecting Topic
  * To see if the data support the general consensus of global warming.
  * To see the temperature trends across the United States.
  * To add to the body of proof and evidence of global warming using the United States temperature data

### Data Source Description
    We used the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley
    National Laboratory.The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 
    pre-existing archives.It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). 
    They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied.

#### Questions we wish to answer
   * What is the trends of  average land temperature in United States
   * Is there any evidence of increase land temperature(global warming) from United States Dataset
   * What is accuracy and precision of the model
